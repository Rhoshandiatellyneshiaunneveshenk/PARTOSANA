        <h1>Nicole Alexandre B. Partosa</h1>
        <p>I am 14 years old, born on the 18th of June</p>
        <p>Blue is my favorite color</p>
        <p>My favorite movies are Get Out, Parasite, and Coraline. I enjoy watching films, especially horror films.</p>
        <p>My favorite place to be is the beach</p>
        <p>I want to pursue Marine Biology, it's been my dream career ever since I was in the fourth grade</p>
        <p>My favorite animals are sharks, capybaras, and cats. I find the stigma surrounding sharks annoying because they are nothing but completely misunderstood by the media, saving them is apart of my dream in pursuing marine biology</p>
